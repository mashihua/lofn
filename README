Lofn
===============
Amor ex Dessis.
(From dess, with love.)

Lofn is a new language on JavaScript. It's aimed to create the new experience of web programming.

Build
---------------
Nowdays, to build my first example in examples/ongi, use this powershell command:

	ls .\examples\ongi\*.lf |%{ .\lfc "$_" |tee "$_.js" }

If there is any syntax error, the .lf.js won't be written.

Naming of versions
---------------
Names of the versions are character names from Toho series. And the developing version is named 'hoejuu'.

Checkout the [release] branch for released versions (with tags).

Convention
---------------
* Primitival functions: UPPERCASED
* Types:                PascalCase
* Prototypes:           camelCase_m
